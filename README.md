This script can do something like Inspect Element using Chrome in Android. You just need to add a bookmark which has a url that contains this script. I've tried using it with other websites like the results when I searched from google, websites from the results given by google, and even this website Stackoverflow. They are all https but this script still can do its job, but there's this Facebook which this script doesn't work. Why is that?
